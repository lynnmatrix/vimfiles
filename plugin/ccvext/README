This is a new version from JumpInCode.vim I don't know why i can't upload a new version to the old JumpInCode page (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2770)? So I start this branch 

ctags and cscope plugin for vim, more convenice way to use ctags and cscope in vim. 

Command: 
\sy Generate tags and cscope database from current directory. 
\sc Configure window --- Take care of the help information below the window. 
D:      Remove the project's database. 
d:      Remove the project from current environment. 
a(/n): Add the project to current environment. 

       Sample_1: 
       :e your_source_.h 
       :cd %:p:h 
       \sy 
       <Enter> 
       :EnQuickSnippet 

       Sample_2: 
       :cd d:\ 
       \sc 
       <Select your database and input enter> 
       :EnQuickSnippet 

       Suggestion: 
       1. <Leader>sy is default script command, if it conflict with your other script you can change it at line 753 of script. 
       2. <Leader>sy is default script command, if it conflict with your other script you can change it at line 754 of script. 
       3. Command EnQuickSnippet, DiQuickSnippet are not mapped, for convenient way is map it to your own command in your .vimrc or _vimrc file.
